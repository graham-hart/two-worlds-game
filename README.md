# Two Worlds (Working Title)

---
### Idea:
* Pending names:
  * Miri (short for mirielle, meaning miracle) - innocent
  * Nera (short for neramus, meaning restless) - damaged
* Two worlds:
  * Cutesy, innocent world 
  * Hellish world w/ monsters (bullet hell?)
* Two characters:
    * Miri is innocent
    * Nera is emotionally damaged, trying to protect Miri, but resents her (abusive parents?)
    * Sisters
* Mechanic:
    * Miri is unable to enter hellworld
    * Nera must help the innocent through by opening passageways
* Storyline:
    * Miri is helped by damaged hero
    * Sisters who both kind of hate each other, but stick together
    * Nera eventually accidentally allows evil monster into innocent world
        * Miri is unable to fight off monster, dies
        * Nera's attempts to shelter/protect Miri ultimately kills her sister
