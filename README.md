# Two Worlds (Working Title)

---
### Idea:
* Two worlds:
  * Cutesy, innocent world 
  * Hellish world w/ monsters (bullet hell?)
* Two characters:
    * One is innocent
    * Other is emotionally damaged, trying to protect the innocent one
    * Somehow subvert the very obvious trope?
* Mechanic:
    * Innocent character is unable to enter hellworld
    * Damaged character must help the innocent through by opening passageways
* Storyline:
    * Innocent character is helped by damaged hero
    * Sisters who both kind of hate each other, but stick together
    * Damaged character eventually accidentally allows evil monster into innocent world
        * Innocent must fight off monster
